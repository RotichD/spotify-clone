# Spoofy | Spotify Clone
Built to explore and practice Front End Development concepts and technologies

## Description
I build this clone of Spotify to practice Front End Design concepts and learn more about Front End Development
- This Web App Controls any instance of Spotify Player running on another app or device. (example: TV, Amazon Echo, Web App, Desktop App, Mobile App)
- This utilizes the spotify-web-api-node package & NextAuth to make calls to the SpotifyAPI
- Explores Authentication, Design, and TypeScript

## Usage
Visit [Spoofy | Spotify Clone]() and sign in with your Spotify account. Next make sure Spotify is playing on another device. Now you can control that device with this web app.

## Features
Please note I did not recreate every feature available in the Spotify App
- Authentication: NextAuth
- Middleware: NextJS Middleware
- Responsive Design: Even more so than the actual spotify web app
- Media Playback: Controls playback on another device (play, pause, skip, previous, volume)
- Load User's Playlists: Loads Playlists, Allows user to select song within playlists.

## Credit
I referrenced a tutorial by Sonny Sangha. However, that tutorial used NextJS12 and Javascript. I opted to use NextJS13 with the experimental App directory with TypeScript to provide myself with an aditional challenge. I also added extra funtionality and modeled my design after the more current up to date version of the Spotify Web App.
